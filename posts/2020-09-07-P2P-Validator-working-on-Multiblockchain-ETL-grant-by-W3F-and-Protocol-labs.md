#### 7th September 2020 - P2P Validator is delighted to announce their grant work on connecting the Polkadot and Filecoin ecosystems by creating an ETL solution with unified API , together with Web3 Foundation and Protocol Labs.

Over the past few years, the world has seen the rise of blockchain interoperability; with the attraction DeFi tools and platforms are getting nowadays, the idea of making the blockchain world more interoperable has become ingrained. The blockchain ecosystem has already attracted thousands of software developers working on different things - applications, wallets, dashboards, explorers - but by inserting interoperability into this equation brings an additional challenge.

Imagine a situation where a user moves a chain A asset through bridge B to parachain X to open a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP), then uses received stablecoin to long a synthetic asset from parachain D on a margin trade chain E. Ten years ago this could sound like nonsense - but this is a reality now. To make efficient applications that would allow this behavior - the developers need appropriate tools.

*“The data access velocity in decentralized systems is still insufficient to allow developers to build applications with convenient users' experience”*, says Konstantin Lomashuk, founder P2P Validator. *“We are moving much further by not only providing the data at high speed but allowing clients to merge several interchain requests in the single one.”*

To begin this journey, we've decided to create an ETL solution for blockchains with a GraphQL API for the collected data. The solution aims to add value and decrease development costs for every company or individual who is working on application development. GraphQL as an API query language has been chosen to unify the data interface to simplify the development process and provide the best quality real-time data for applications.

As a validator, we have a unique opportunity to develop such a system: 
- we have developed our dashboards and other tools that require a deep dive into specific blockchain's architecture
- blockchain node management does not add costs to the solution as we already maintain them
- we are familiar with a variety of blockchains 
- we are trusted by more than 2000 users staking their assets with us 


Although our ultimate goal is to provide a high-quality data source for lots of blockchains, we've chosen Polkadot and Filecoin to be the pioneers in this project. We would love to see services that would utilize this solution and supply a justified demand for more blockchains to be added as data sources.

*“We are excited to work together with Protocol Labs and P2P validator to create an interoperability-first data warehouse across all kinds of different blockchains. This will make it easier to integrate with different blockchains and ultimately help the entire ecosystem ”*, says David Hawig, Grants Lead at Web3 Foundation.  

*"In collaboration with Web3 Foundation we’re delighted to support P2P Validator as they build an ETL solution to simplify the process of building wallets, dashboards, explorers and apps that interact with multiple blockchains connected through interchain communication protocol"*, says Eva Shon, Grants Coordinator at Protocol Labs.
