*This guide will help you to nominate validators in Polkadot network. Make sure that you have [created account](https://economy.p2p.org/create-account-in-polkadot-network) with mainnet address and [claimed DOT](https://economy.p2p.org/claim-dot-with-polkadotjs) tokens.* 

# Nominate validators

1. Visit the[ Polkadot UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) and select `Staking` tab. Choose `Account actions` in the top menu and press `+ Nominator` button.

2. In the modal window choose your stash account and a controller account (in our case they are the same and their names and addresses will match). Put the number of DOT you are willing to bond. **This amount should be less than the total amount in your stash** to pay tx fees or set a separate controller account for your stash account in future. It is recommended to leave at least 5% not bonded.
3. Press `next` button.

4. At this step you will be able to nominate up to 16 validators. Choose validators from the left box. You can easily find a particular validator by pasting his address in the blank search field.

   You cannot specify the amount delegated to a particular validator, bonded stake automatically will spread among selected validators by the algorithm after transition to NPoS.

7. In the `Account actions` you will see your bonded account. Your nomination will be in `Waiting` status until the transition to NPoS.
