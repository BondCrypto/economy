*This guide will help you to nominate validators in Polkadot network. Make sure that you have [created account](https://economy.p2p.org/create-account-in-polkadot-network) with mainnet address and [claimed DOT](https://economy.p2p.org/claim-dot-with-polkadotjs) tokens.* 

# Nominate validators

1. Visit the[ Polkadot UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) and select `Staking` tab. Choose `Account actions` in the top menu and press `+ Nominator` button.

2. In the modal window choose your stash account and a controller account (in our case they are the same and their names and addresses will match). Put the number of DOT you are willing to bond. **This amount should be less than the total amount in your stash** to pay tx fees or set a separate controller account for your stash account in future. It is recommended to leave at least 5% not bonded.
3. Press `next` button.

4. At this step you will be able to nominate up to 16 validators. Choose validators from the left box. You can easily find a particular validator by pasting his address in the blank search field.

   You cannot specify the amount delegated to a particular validator, bonded stake automatically will spread among selected validators by the algorithm after transition to NPoS.

5. To nominate P2P Validator pick all `P2P.ORG` from the left column or simply **copy our addresses one by one** and paste them in the search field. Don't press `Bond & Nominate` button until you add all addresses.

**Here are P2P addresses:**  

1. `16DKyH4fggEXeGwCytqM19e9NFGkgR2neZPDJ5ta8BKpPbPK`
2. `15qomv8YFTpHrbiJKicP4oXfxRDyG4XEHZH7jdfJScnw2xnV`
3. `14QBQABMSFBsT3pDTaEQdshq7ZLmhzKiae2weZH45pw5ErYu`
4. `11uMPbeaEDJhUxzU4ZfWW9VQEsryP9XqFcNRfPdYda6aFWJ`
5. `121gZtuuG6sq3BZp1UKg8oRLRZvp89SAYSxXypwDJjaSRJR5`
6. `15oKi7HoBQbwwdQc47k71q4sJJWnu5opn1pqoGx4NAEYZSHs`

Press with the left click on the account appeared in the left column to add it to your nomination list. Address will appear in the right column.

6. Press `Bond & Nominate` button and confirm the transaction.

After that your funds will be locked. They will become available only after **unbonding** that **will last for 28 days after initiating**.

7. In the `Account actions` you will see your bonded account. Your nomination will be in `Waiting` status until the transition to NPoS. After that system will distribute your stake in an optimal way and you will see that nomination status changed on `Active` at least for one target and you will receive DOT rewards.
