*This guide will help you to nominate validators in Polkadot network. Make sure that you have [created account](https://economy.p2p.org/create-account-in-polkadot-network) with mainnet address and [claimed DOT](https://economy.p2p.org/claim-dot-with-polkadotjs) tokens.* 

# Nominate validators

**a)** First you need to bond your DOT that are in the stash account. 

Visit the[ Polkadot UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) and select `Staking` tab. Choose `Account actions` in the top menu and press `+ Nominator` button.

In the modal window choose your stash account and a controller account (in our case they are the same and their names and addresses will match). Put the number of DOT you are willing to bond. **This amount should be less than the total amount in your stash** to pay tx fees or set a separate controller account for your stash account in future. It is recommended to leave at least 5% not bonded.

Press `next` and finish the process. After that your funds will be locked. They will become available only after **unbonding** that **will last for 28 days after initiating**.

**b)** After your DOT are bonded you will be able to nominate up to 16 validators. You cannot specify the amount delegated to a particular validator, bonded stake automatically will spread among selected validators by the algorithm after transition to NPoS.

Choose press the button with three dots in `Account actions` tab.

In the `Account actions` you will see your bonded account. Your nomination will be in `Waiting` status until the transition to NPoS. After that system will distribute your stake in an optimal way and you will see that nomination status changed on `Active` at least for one target and you will receive DOT rewards.
