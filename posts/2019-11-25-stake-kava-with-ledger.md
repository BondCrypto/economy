> Now you can safely stake KAVA with P2P Validator using your Ledger wallet.
> There is no need to interact with kvcli. Just connect your Ledger and follow three simple steps. We offer you a non-custodial secure solution and by no means have access to your funds.

  To start go to [p2p.org/kava](https://p2p.org/kava?utm_source=Kava_Ledger&utm_medium=creds_link&utm_campaign=blog) and click "Delegate with Ledger" button

## Step 1. Connect your Ledger Device and Navigate to Cosmos App

## Step 2. Choose amount

After a successful connection, you will see your address and available balance for delegation in the opened window. 
Put the amount you wish to stake and press "Continue"

> If you have multiple addresses in your Ledger you can switch accounts by changing the "path" and reconnect.

## Step 3. Confirm Transaction
