P2P Validator has been supporting Cosmos network from day one, **providing high-quality validation services** for ATOM delegators. Our **developed products allow delegators** to easily manage investments and receive a detailed report on their staking income.

**We invest in the development of Cosmos network** and see the long-term prospects, however, the costs of maintaining the infrastructure and product development are several times higher than the revenues that the validator receives currently. We have decided to **return to a commission of 8% in 21 days** to remain flexible and provide more sustainable services.
 
## What have we done?

For more than 5 months of hard work under a reduced fee, we **did not stop the development activity** in the Cosmos network. Here is a list of the **most significant achievements** that have been released  for the Cosmos ecosystem:

1. [P2P Dashboard](https://p2p.org/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=economy&utm_campaign=cosmos_fee#dashboard-block) for Cosmos users:
   * Track and predict user rewards (more correctly than major explorers, check out our [article](https://economy.p2p.org/lost-in-cosmos-explorers?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=economy&utm_campaign=cosmos_fee))
   * Ledger delegation, redelegation, claim of rewards
   * Rewards report for all Cosmos Hubs (1,2,3)
   * CSV reward report
2. [9 articles](https://economy.p2p.org/category/cosmos?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=economy&utm_campaign=cosmos_fee) and users guides posted 
3. [Visualization of IBC handshakes](https://goz.p2p.org/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=economy&utm_campaign=cosmos_fee) for the Game of Zones
4. [Documentation](https://github.com/p2p-org/relayer/blob/master/docs/commands.md) and [dashboards](https://dash-goz.p2p.org/public/dashboards/PxNuUZv6XxsUwETE4iWhLiVEUIOiFlD3GJhPig6P?org_slug=default) for Game of Zones
5. [Affiliate API](https://defiapi.com/) for Cosmos wallet monetization 
6. We financially [supported Corestar team](https://economy.p2p.org/p2p-validator-acquired-corestar-development-team?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=economy&utm_campaign=cosmos_fee), who developed Arcade, Tendermint hack with built-in [BLS random beacon](https://economy.p2p.org/p2p-validator-helps-to-carry-out-random-beacon-for-Cosmos?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=economy&utm_campaign=cosmos_fee) built on ICF grant
7. Ongoing work on public rate-limited GraphQL API for Cosmos applications

Product development inside the ecosystem is an essential element not only to support the Cosmos network, but also as a part of the **long-term growth of the community and the network value.**

## When will the commission be increased?

We will increase the commission by 1% every day, starting from June 12. **On June 18, our rate will remain at 8%.** There is a lot of work ahead and we believe that **joint efforts will accelerate the evolution of Cosmos network.**

We want to **thank all our delegators** for their continuous support and being with us! **If you stake ATOM with P2P  - you contribute to the Cosmos ecosystem.**
