Our team have updated the delegation tool using the Ledger device on the Cosmos network so now users can go through the redelegation process without leaving p2p.org

> P2P.ORG - offers Secure & Non-Custodial Staking. No operations are possible without your confirmation, we will not request or store your private key or initial phrase. 

The redelegation process allows you to change which validator you are delegating at any time, without any delay and free of charge.

Use this function to change your validator if you are no longer satisfied with its services or terms. For example, increased commission rates, long downtimes that reduce your rewards, or other factors.

The whole process of re-delegating your Atoms is simple and can be done in a safe way in just a few minutes.

To get started just go to [p2p.org/cosmos](https://p2p.org/cosmos?utm_source=Cosmos_Redelegate&utm_medium=creds_link&utm_campaign=blog), click the Stake with Ledger button and select Redelegate.

## Step 1. Plug in your Ledger device and open the Cosmos app

## Step 2. Choose validator and then the amount for Redelegation

> If you have multiple addresses in your Ledger you can switch accounts by changing the "path" and reconnect.

Note about Redelegation:
- You can Redelegate a certain amount of Atoms from one validator to another
- Can only be used if already bonded to a validator
- Redelegation takes effect immediately, there is no waiting period to redelegate
- After a redelegation, no other redelegation can be made from the account for the next 3 weeks


## Step 3. Confirm the transaction on your Ledger
