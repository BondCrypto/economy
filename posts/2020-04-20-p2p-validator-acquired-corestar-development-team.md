We are thrilled to announce that [Corestar](https://corestar.io) team joined P2P Validator to create synergy in the development of decentralized ecosystems. 

Our team have always been looking for ways to add more value to the projects we believe in. Comprehensive contribution is an important part of our long term vision. **All our thoughts are concentrated on actions facilitating the continuous progress of decentralized networks.** [By staking ATOM with us](https://p2p.org/cosmos) you support our efforts to deliver meaningful results in the long run.

P2P Validator provides non-custodial staking including valuable tools for delegators, community building, educational enlightenment and *with acquisition of Corestar team we will add solid development activities to the scope of our capabilities*.

### About Corestar

[Corestar](https://corestar.io) is a team of dedicated professionals focused on research and development within the Cosmos ecosystem. A lot of effort was concentrated on NFT marketplace over IBC and Corestar got onto the list of [HackAtom Berlin](https://blog.cosmos.network/cosmos-hackatom-berlin-recap-4722882e7623) finalists with MVP that grew into the [Open Market](https://openmarket.one) project.

In addition, Corestar received an ICF grant to develop [Arcade](https://github.com/corestario/tendermint) - Tendermint implementation with built-in random beacon. Arcade will provide application-specific blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem with a decentralized source of entropy to power various applications like cryptography, games and gambling platforms without changing the security assumptions of Tendermint.

*We believe that the Corestar team will significantly strengthen our development department and benefit the Cosmos ecosystem.*

### Immediate perspectives

IBC is currently the most important milestone in the success of Cosmos and the launch of incentivized testnet "[Game Of Zones](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/)" is near at hand. As an active contributor, P2P Validator will take part in the competition with additional development resources, ready to deliver.

We have prepared a [visualization](https://goz.p2p.org/) of handshakes between nodes to help participants monitor the current status of connections during the contest.
