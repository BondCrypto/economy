Token holders in the Tezos network are faced with the **problem of tracking received and expected rewards** from their baker. Often, a user who has delegated his assets does not have the opportunity to check and if the baker delays payment or stops paying at all (as was the case with Flippin Tacos), he **loses the reward.**
All this is even more difficult if you have several addresses from which you delegate to different bakers.

**P2P Dashboard gives Tezos users an easy way to track payouts for their current baker.** By adding one or more addresses to the panel, you can find information about current delegations, balances, and payments. 

>“Since we launched P2P Dashboard, our goal has been to create a product that will make life easier for delegators, and the payment of rewards more transparent. 
>Now, we want you to find out what we are working on and so we have opened it up for all token holders to use without registration or fees.
