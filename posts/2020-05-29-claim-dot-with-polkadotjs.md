*This guide will walk you through the process of claiming DOT tokens. Make sure that you have [created Polkadot account](https://economy.p2p.org/create-account-in-polkadot-network). After successful claim you can [start nominating](https://economy.p2p.org/polkadot-nomination-guide).*

# Claim your DOT

After account registration you need to claim your DOT. Go to the [claim app](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/claims) on Polkadot UI,  select your account and press `Continue`.

You will need to sign the message in a grey box with the ETH address that has DOT indicator tokens and paste the transaction signature in the empty box below.

To sign a transaction you can use MyCrypto (MC) or MyEtherWallet (MEW). For increased security, you can run one of the preferred applications on your local computer. Make sure that you have downloaded the latest version for your operating system.

In MC go to `Sign & Verify Message`, in MEW go to `Message` tab. Copy text from the dotted box in the Polkadot claim app you used at the start and paste it into the empty message box in the MC or MEW and click `Sign`.

After that you will get an output. Copy and paste it into the empty box in the Polkadot claim app and press `Confirm claim`.

If you have a valid claim you will see a green box with the amount of DOT. Press `Claim` and then press `Submit (no signature)` to finish the process. Go to the `Account ` tab and verify that tokens have appeared on the balance of your account.

Now you are able to take part in staking and nominate, token transfers are prohibited at the moment.
