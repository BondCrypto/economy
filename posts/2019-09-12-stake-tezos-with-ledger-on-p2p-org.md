Staking is always comes with some degree of risk. The delegation process in most cases is not a simple one and a possible danger lies in the need to store your tokens with a third party provider in order to improve your staking experience. The fundamental rule is: your keys - your crypto. When you hold your keys you control the risk, when you use third parties in order to simplify the delegation process you transfer the risk to them.

One of the most secure ways to become a delegator is to use cold staking from your hardware wallet even if sometimes it is less convenient. Today, we are happy to announce that you no longer have to sacrifice safety for convenience. Now you can simply hold your Tezos in your Ledger and safely delegate or re-delegate to P2P Validator using a simple staking tool on our website.
