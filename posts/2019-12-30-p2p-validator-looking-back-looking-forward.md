2019 was a year chock full with meaningful events in staking space. It was marked by the launch of [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/), [Terra money](https://terra.money/), [IRIS network](https://www.irisnet.org/), [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/), [Kusama network](https://kusama.network/), [Kava](https://www.kava.io/) and many other Proof-Of-Stake based blockchains on mainnet.

There are lots of ongoing activities across various systems, solid projects with high potential for finding market fit launched incentivized testnets. [Solana](https://solana.com/), [Oasis Labs](https://www.oasislabs.com/) and [Celo](https://celo.org/) are amongst them.

We joined [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) as a node operator to improve decentralization of an oracle network and help solving the lack of real-world data for smart-contracts.

In [Tezos](https://tezos.com/), Cosmos Hub and IRIS network **we participated in every on-chain governance** and there was a great feeling of true collaboration between stakeholders who are really interested in the best possible future for the ecosystem.

In 2019 [Cosmos ecosystem](https://cosmonauts.world/) grew to over 100 projects and [Tezos ecosystem](https://tezosprojects.com/) attracted over 1000 developers to facilitate continuous building. The Proof-Of-Stake space is still highly experimental and we are excited to be at the front of the movement to a fair and efficient future.

# P2P Validator vision

Since January 1st of 2019, asset value locked in staking increased nine times over and [reached $6,5B](https://www.stakingrewards.com/global-charts).

We are absolutely confident that the **Proof-Of-Stake ecosystem will continue to grow**. With this in mind, P2P Validator will continue to extend communities of enthusiasts and developers. We will show the best ways of staking and the various opportunities offered by novel business models across the networks we support.

We will also **focus on making staking as simple, secure and attractive as possible**. For us being a reliable validator is a key business activity. Our focus here is on slashing risk minimization and active participation in governance of various platforms.

**Non-custodial staking** allows every user to be in control of their assets eliminating risks associated with third parties and **represents the safest way of participating in the ecosystem, especially for big investors**. Our goal is to simplify interactions with hardware wallets by UI and be competitive in terms of various complementary services. Today, only at [p2p.org](https://p2p.org) you can delegate ATOM, KAVA and XTZ with ledger in one place using our simple delegation tool.

As of today, we provide validation services for 15 networks including testnets and **plan to support more groundbreaking projects** that have competitive advantages and a clear go-to market strategy. The process of making decisions about joining a network is complex as our resources and ability to add sufficient value are limited. As part of this, we are closely watching the development of [Dfinity](https://dfinity.org/), [NuCypher](https://www.nucypher.com/), [Telegram Open Network](https://test.ton.org/tblkch.pdf), [Polkadot Network](https://polkadot.network/), and projects emerging in the Cosmos ecosystem.

# Our achievements

We started as a small bakery in Tezos with only $2m value delegated with us, most of it our own funds. Today over $35m is locked in staking through our infrastructure across 15 blockchains and more than 700 delegators use our services trusting our expertise.

**We paid out over $700k rewards** to our delegators making each transaction transparent and available in our multi-asset dashboard. 

For our Tezos delegators we **insured all payouts** with [Baking Bad](https://baking-bad.org/) and have shortened the time before the first payout by 40% eliminating the 5 cycle freeze for rewards. In addition, we achieved **stable AAA+ rating** on MyTezosBaker with **over 100% baking efficiency** according to [TezosNodes](https://www.tezos-nodes.com/) reaching the **top 5 Tezos validators** by staking balance. We are proud to be such a robust staking partner and we will continue to do our best to remain so and improve further.

Overall, the uptime of our nodes across all networks is 99,98%. This is a good measurement of our availability and the robustness of our setup. 

**We haven't experienced any downtime or double-sign slashing** even in the case of a Google Cloud provider crash as we had set **best class monitoring and alert systems** working for the convenience of our delegators 24/7.

To contribute to building the community we conducted the first meetup related to Cosmos network in Moscow. We co-organized the First Tezos Moscow meetup supported by [Tezos Commons](https://tezoscommons.org/). If you missed it you can watch a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4O5M30Exrg1abhacOJKUVw) with English subtitles.

We were one of the winners of Cosmos Game Of Stakes and participated in incentivized testnets of IRIS Network, Terra Money, DAO BET, Cyberway, Kava, Kusama Network since the beginning providing validation services **on mainnet since the first day**.
