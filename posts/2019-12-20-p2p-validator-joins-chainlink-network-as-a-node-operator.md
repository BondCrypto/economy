The question of blockchains having trustless connection with external data is significant for the real-world implementation of highly functional smart-contracts in both new and traditional industries. Not only do they require connection to external resources, but the off-chain connection must maintain the same properties of decentralized security currently available on the underlying blockchain. With that in mind, P2P Validator is thrilled to announce the launch of our Chainlink node with the mission of providing smart-contracts with the required data feeds in an increasingly decentralized manner. 



Decentralized oracles solve smart contract’s lack of connection with external resources without sacrificing trustworthiness. This keeps digital agreements reliable and tamper-proof end-to-end, which is crucial for real-world usage. This vision is in line with our mission to promote the value of blockchain assets and give people access to the emerging data-driven economy.



Our developer team has extensive experience in setting up secure infrastructure. P2P Validator maintains high-availability nodes and provides secure staking services for the most groundbreaking projects in the blockchain space. The node infrastructure is under advanced monitoring with 24/7 technical support, backups and alerts.
