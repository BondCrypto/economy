# How to delegate your ADA with Ledger Nano S/X 

This guide will walk you step-by-step through the process of delegation in Cardano using the ledger device.

---

First of all [download ledger live app](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395553) on your device, connect the ledger and [make sure it is up to date](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113) with the actual version of firmware. Install Cardano app and check that the corresponding icon has appeared on the display of your ledger.

1. Go to https://adalite.io/ and select hardware wallet as the preferred access method.

6. After successful confirmation the wallet info will be available on your device. If you have ADA on your ledger go to step `#6`. If not, scroll down to the list of your addresses and send ADA to one of them.

8. In the Delegate stake field you can put our pool ID.
**P2P Validator Pool:** `33c1bf1a04ba85d8fd6119a08ee7f4ad659add075e2208b28862a2a1`
Wait for the appearance of pool info as on the screen below and press `Delegate` button.

9. In the confirmation window double check that the pool info is correct. You will need to reserve **2 ADA** to create a staking address on top of the transaction fee. You will be able to return the reserve if you cancel staking and won't be using  that address any more. This functionality is currently unavailable in ADAlite wallet. Click `Confirm` Transaction.

10. In the following step you will be asked to confirm registration of a staking key and delegation via ledger. On the ledger screen you will see the slot and epoch when the delegation is made. Press **both buttons** to continue.

12. Confirm the delegation itself. It will become active after two epochs (~10 days). In Cardano there is no slashing so your funds are safe.
