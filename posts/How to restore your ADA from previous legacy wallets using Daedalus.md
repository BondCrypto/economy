This guide is designed to help you to restore your ADA from legacy Daedalus, Yoroi or Hardware wallets.

## Create A New Daedalus Wallet
First of all, you need to create a new Daedalus wallet to load  your funds from a legacy one. Ensure that you have the latest version of the wallet or download it from offical [Daedalus wallet](https://daedaluswallet.io/#download) page.
1. After the sync has reached 100%, go to the dashboard and click the `Create` button.

4. At the next step, you will be prompted on how to use the 24-word Recovery Phrase. **Read it carefully since if you lose your wallet recovery phrase you will not get a chance to take your ADA back.**

- If you have used **Yoroi** wallet and now for some reason would like to try Daedalus, you can employ the “Restore Yoroi wallet” feature to move your funds to a newly created Daedalus wallet.

- You can  also  restore your funds from **Hardware wallets** such as **Ledger (Byron legacy wallet)** or **Trezor (Byron legacy wallet).** However, read the recommendations provided by IOHK team -carefully- to avoid exposing your hardware wallet private keys to  security risks.
